1.My implementation of data sequencing and retransmission is different from traditional TCP in the following ways.
The TCP framework uses a dynamic size of chunks(packets) depending upon the network conditions where as in the implementation used by me the size of chunk is 12 characters always.
Further, the retransmission time is also efficiently determined based on network conditions and several other where as in my implementation the retransmission is always done when we have iterated over all other chunks and transmitted them. The time will depend on number of chunks as well because the number of iterations are directly proportional to number of chunks.

2.To extend the implementation to account for flow control we ned to implement a sliding window mechanism in both the client and server. The sender (client) should maintain a send window, and the receiver (server) should maintain a receive window. The client should keep track of the receiver's available window space.Before sending a new chunk, the client checks if there is enough space in the receiver's window to accommodate the chunk. If there is space, it sends the chunk ,otherwise, it waits until there is enough space.The server should keep track of the received chunks and their order. It should acknowledge the received chunks and inform the client about the available window space. If the server receives an out-of-order chunk, it should buffer it and acknowledge the chunks in order.
